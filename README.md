# Netflix Clone

Welcome to the Netflix Clone project! This project is a front-end recreation of the popular streaming service Netflix using only HTML and CSS. It serves as an educational exercise in building a web page with a layout similar to Netflix's homepage.

## Features
- **Homepage Layout**: The project closely replicates the Netflix homepage layout, including sections like the hero section, FAQ section, and footer.
- **Responsive Design**: The page is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes for a smooth user experience.
- **Animated Video Playback**: Incorporates video autoplay and loop features in the design.
- **Multiple Languages**: Includes a dropdown for switching between languages (English and Hindi).
- **Frequently Asked Questions**: Interactive FAQ section for user engagement.
- **Download Option**: A section discussing downloading shows for offline viewing.
